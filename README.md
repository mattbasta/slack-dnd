# slack-dnd

Handy tools for creating slackbot responses for DND games. Some documentation is in each script.

These are very incomplete and probably buggy, but I enjoy them and they're quite nice. If you have suggestions or additions, please submit pull requests. Only CC0 contributions will be accepted.

Currently, scripts are designed to run under Python 2.7, since it's bundled with OS X. Contributions to update code to Py3K (and remain backwards-compatible) are very welcome.
